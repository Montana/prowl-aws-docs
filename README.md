## Amazon Web Services for Prowl 

This is documentaiton in regards to how we are using Prowl with AWS.

## Amazon QuickSight

QuickSight from the AWS suite that is simply a tool to visually build ad-hoc queries. As of now, there is no API for it so that we can automatically generate dashboards and there is no built in way to run statistical testing. For this, we can use Plotly, or something similar.
